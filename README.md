Below and contained within this repo are samples of code I have written in class and at work, mostly the former.

### Potions Work

I worked on a game for a research study regarding rejection bias over the past two terms.  Here are samples of my code for a mechanism that would save certain specific values or location names when the user encounters them within the story.  At the very end, I iterate through the datamap and prints each value to a long URL that allows researchers to see what decisions the players made within the game.

I also wrote JS in Qualtrics to hack the system and implement a reward system that shows certain animations depending on how many previous quizzes were taken, and reward raffle tickets as a bonus to people who complete several quizzes in a roll.  

### CS50 Work

At the end of CS50, two other students and I worked on a program that would return and receive commands from a server through threading to solve a maze.  Here are some excerpts of code I wrote for the project.
